Description: # hyperpeer-py 
        hyperpeer-py is the python module for implementing media servers or backend peers in applications based on Hyperpeer. This module provides a class called [Peer](#Peer) which manages both the connection with the signaling server and the peer-to-peer communication via WebRTC with remote peers. It also provides an __Enum__ class called [PeerState](#peerstate) that defines the possible states of a [Peer](#peer) instance.
